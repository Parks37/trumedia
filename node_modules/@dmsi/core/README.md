### Useful (Small) Libraries

- dot-prop: get, set, or delete a property from a nested object using a dot path
- deepmerge: merges the enumerable properties of two or more objects deeply
- klona: a tiny and fast utility to "deep clone" Objects, Arrays, Dates, RegExps, and more
- pipr: a tiny function for piping the results of one function to the next

### Versioning

DMSi Constants conforms to the semver spec for versioning. The library is versioned separately from other @dmsi packages. Check out the CHANGELOG to see what's changed.

### Local Development

For most development purposes, symlinking @dmsi/core with a consuming package should be sufficient. However in certain cases the developer may have trouble symlinking to packages with competing dependency versions. In this case you may run `yarn publish:test`, which will publish a `tc` version for local development. The package must be updated to a major/minor/patch/rc version before being merged into develop.
