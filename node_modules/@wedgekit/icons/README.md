# Icons

## Purpose

The icon package provides approved svg's for use in wegekit related applications.

## Usage

```jsx
import Icon, { IconWidth } from '@wedgekit/icons';

const Example = () => (
  <IconWidth iconWidth={64}>
    <Icon> save </Icon>
  </IconWidth>
);

render(<Example />);
```

## Props

### children

Type: `IconTag`

Required: ✅

The child of an Icon component is an `IconTag`. An `IconTag` is a snake-cased name of a provided icon. A full list can be found [here](/visualGuidelines/icons/design)

### className

Type: `string`

required: ❌

This is exposed but is only here so that styled-components will be able to style components correctly. Please do not use this unless you really know what you are doing.

### color

Type: `ColorTag`

Required: ❌

Icon color. All `ColorTag` options can be found [here](/visualGuidelines/color/design).

### disabled

Type: `boolean`

Required: ❌

A disabled icon will have a `not-allowed` cursor styling.

## Development

Icons offers a `yarn start` command for watching changes made on the module. It is important to note that the expectation is that this is only really useful when doing development on the `Icon` component. Any changes to the svg folder would not be compiled unless `yarn build:icons` is manually run. Typically the work of adding icons versus working on the Icon component will be done separately, so this will be rare.
