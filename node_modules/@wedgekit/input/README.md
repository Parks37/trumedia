# @wedgekit/input

## Purpose

The `Input` component is a styled, slightly opinionated wrapper around an HTML input where the user can enter data.

## Basic Implementation

```typescript
import Input from '@wedgekit/core';

const Example = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');

  return <Input label="Input Component Example" value={value} onChange={setValue} />;
};

render(<Example />);
```
