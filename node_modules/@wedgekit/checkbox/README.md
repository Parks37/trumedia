# Checkbox

## Purpose

The checkbox component is used to indicate an input that can have a boolean state (on/off), as well as indicating an indeterminate state.

## Usage

```jsx
import Checkbox from '@wedgekit/checkbox';

const Example = () => {
  const [allDayEvent, setAllDayEvent] = React.useState(false);
  return (
    <Checkbox
      label="My Checkbox"
      value={allDayEvent}
      onChange={(newValue) => {
        setAllDayEvent(newValue);
      }}
    />
  );
};

render(<Example />);
```
