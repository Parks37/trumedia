# Indicators

Two types, represented by different animations to indicate loading. Both are a combination of the focus and disabled state.  

## On submit

- Used to show submission has occurred, but needs a moment to load 
- Typically contained to a primary button in a header or footer 

export const SubmitExample = () =>  (
    <TabbedComponentViewer tabs={['submit']}>
        <Submit color="B500" size={24}/> 
    </TabbedComponentViewer>
  );

<SubmitExample />

## Loading

- Example: after login, represents the page is processing user credentials  
- Centered within the screen  
- White overlay 

export const LoadingExample = () =>  (
    <TabbedComponentViewer tabs={['loading']}>
        <Loading color="D500" size={40}/> 
    </TabbedComponentViewer>
  );

<LoadingExample />
