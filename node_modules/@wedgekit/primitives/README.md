# Primitives

Primitives are the building blocks of WedgeKit components. They are largely settings or wrapper components designed for keeping all WedgeKit components consistent in a composable and discoverable way.

## Usage

```typescript static
import settings from '@wedgekit/primitives';
```

## Settings

`@wedgekit/primitives` exports a settings object as its default export. These settings are intended to enforce consistency across `wedgekit` and A2W apps. The following settings are included in the settings object:

**animations**

transitions for `transform`, `box-shadow`, and `border` are included in `settings.animations`

**base**

base is a set number of pixels that all sizes in `wedgekit` and A2W apps should be based on; inspired by Evergreen UI's [major scale](https://evergreen.segment.com/foundations/layers#recommendation:_use_the_8px_major_scale_grid)

**border**

provides `width` and `radius` settings

**colors**

contains `status` color codes

**cursor**

the CSS styles for `disabled` and `readOnly`

**font**

`code` font settings

**fontFamily**

a CSS complaint `font-family` string

**fontSize**

provides sizes for the following:

- label
- link
- body
- bodySmall
- input
- tooltip
- h1
- h2
- h3
- h4
- h5
- h6

**fontWeight**

provides font-weights for `title`, `normal` & `link`

**tabIndex**

the tabIndex for `disabled` for those who strongly prefer package exports over extremely trivial code

**widths**

inexplicably the widths for `toast` and `multiselect-card` are in settings and not in their respective components

**zindex**

z-index values for `modal` and `header`

## Typography

### Text

All A2W text should use this component in order to maintain design system typography standards. The underlying DOM element is a `p`

#### Props

**small**

required: ❌

type: `boolean`

```typescript jsx
import { Text } from '@wedgekit/primitives';

const TextExample = () => <Text>Hello, World!</Text>;

render(<TextExample />);
```

### Title

The title component is used for headers throughout A2W.

#### Props

**children**

type: `string`

**elementLevel**

required: ❌

type `1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6`

Indicates the underlying DOM element (e.g. `h1`) that the component will render. If this is not specified the component will render a `div` instead.

**level**

required: ❌

type `1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6`

Indicates the visual header level. This only afects styling and has no impact on the underlying DOM.

**white**

For use on dark backgrounds.

```typescript jsx

#### Props

**dark**

## Animations

### withUpDown

`withUpDown` is a React [HOC](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) which has a `direction` prop which can be set to `up` or `down`. It will transform the content 180 degrees when `direction` is `up`

## Utilities

### Fieldset

Creates a `fieldset` element for use with Wedgekit form components. It will suppress standard browser form styling to avoid unexpected alignment issues.

### FieldStatusWrapper

This styles a label somewhere further down the DOM tree. I assume this is expecting the label to be within a component you can't access for some reason; but this is a horrifically clunky API if so. I hope I didn't come up with this idea.

#### Props

**disabled**

required: ❌

type: `boolean`

**invalid**

required: ❌

type: `boolean`

**readOnly**

required: ❌

type: `boolean`

### FocusIndicator

This, just like the field state wrapper above, also styles a label further down in the DOM tree, but in addition also styles it differently if focus is within the label. Again, an embarrassing API.

#### Props

**disabled**

required: ❌

type: `boolean`

**invalid**

required: ❌

type: `boolean`

**readOnly**

required: ❌

type: `boolean`

### Row

Everything you wrap in this will be rendered in a row, with design-system compliant spacing between items.

#### Props

**center**

required: ❌

type: `boolean`
