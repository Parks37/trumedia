# Toasts

Toasts give users feedback and confirmation that an action has occurred.  

- Temporary; don’t require user interaction 
- They shouldn’t interrupt users 

export const CenteredButton = styled(Button)`
    margin-left:auto;
    margin-right: auto;
`

export const Test = () => {
  const [toast, setToast] = React.useState(false);
  return (
      <div>
        <TabbedComponentViewer tabs={['Toast']}>
            <CenteredButton onClick={() => setToast(true)}>Show Toast</CenteredButton>
        </TabbedComponentViewer>
        {toast && (
            <Toast
            header="This is the toast title"
            icon="warning"
            message="This is the toast content"
            remove={() => setToast(false)}
            />
        )}
    </div>
  );
};

<Test />
